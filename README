This folder contains the framework to add gallery2 to bitweaver, but does not contain
the actual gallery2 source code. The easiest way to get the code is to use CVS.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/gallery co gallery2

You could also visit http://gallery.sourceforge.net and download the lastest
stable release (minimum Alpha 4)

After Gallery2 is installed
1. Delete their index.php file and replace it with ours. During installation - you will be warned that this file is not the original.
2. Delete their /templates/sidebar.tpl and replace it with ours.

A few key Gallery2 installation tips:

# Be sure to include "User Albums" module when installing.
# Once installed, log in to gallery2 directly and click "Site Admin". Click the
  "User Albums" link and change "Create albums" to "When user is first created".
  Click "Save"
